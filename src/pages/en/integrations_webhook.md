The helper [`vendor.webhook`](/en/automation_helpers#vendorwebhookmethod-string-url-string-body-string) enables uploading anything to anywhere as long as webhooks are supported. It does an HTTP request to the webhook (the HTTP endpoint) thatâ€™s defined by HTTP method and URL in the url argument with the HTTP body as the string in the body argument.

The following example calls a webhook for each health check:

```js
function onItemCaptured(data) {
  if (data.request.path === "/health")
    vendor.webhook("POST", env.WEBHOOK_URL, data);
}
```

> See [`vendor.webhook`](/en/automation_helpers#vendorwebhookmethod-string-url-string-body-string) for more info.
