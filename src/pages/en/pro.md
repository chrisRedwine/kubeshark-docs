## Tier Comparison

Different companies have varying needs. **Kubeshark** offers three distinct editions, each tailored to meet the varied demands of different use cases and company types.

### Community Edition

The Community Edition is free of charge and primarily targets small development and testing clusters. It is available for on-demand use without requiring a license.

> To start using the Community Edition, [install Kubeshark](/en/install).

## Pro Edition

The Pro Edition is suitable for clusters of up to 20 nodes in environments with active internet connectivity. It includes a one-month free license, with the option to upgrade using a credit card.

> To start using the Pro Edition, run `kubeshark pro` in your terminal or visit the [Admin Console](https://console.kubeshark.co/).

## Enterprise Edition

Designed for larger organizations managing multiple, either managed or self-managed, clusters, the Enterprise Edition of **Kubeshark** is equipped with features suitable for demanding environments. These include:
- Enhanced high-speed/high-throughput capabilities
- Support for air-gapped environments
- SAML/SSO integration

Enterprise Edition users also benefit from dedicated support, ensuring swift assistance through Slack, on-demand Zoom calls, premium onboarding services, and a commitment to seamless operations across all clusters.

### SAML/SSO/Authorization

The Enterprise Edition enables developers to access **Kubeshark** through their corporate Identity Provider (IDP) without requiring `kubectl` privileges. Authorization is based on group or organizational affiliation, with network traffic visibility controlled by namespace and pod regex rules aligned with their roles.

### Air-gapped Support

This edition enables the full feature set even in the absence of Internet connectivity, facilitating the local storage of Docker images, scripts, and kernel modules.

### Dedicated Support

Enterprise users receive immediate support through Slack, access to on-demand Zoom calls, premium onboarding, and a guarantee of smooth operations across all clusters.

### High-speed Networks

The Enterprise Edition enhances packet capture and processing speeds, significantly minimizing the overhead typically associated with kernel-level packet handling.
