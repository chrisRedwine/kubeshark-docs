### What types of information we collect

We may collect the following types of information from or about you:

#### Personal Information

Personal Information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual. We gather the following types of Personal Information:

- Registration details: When registering to our Services, we may collect certain information that can be used to identify you (as the Customer’s point of contact or as a User) such as: name, email address, postal address, phone number, user IDs and other relevant details which are relevant to the Customer.
- Customer’s payment information: If you choose to register to the services provided by us for a fee, we will collect payment information from you, including your credit card number and bank account details. Please note that your billing information, to the extent provided by you, is forwarded directly to a third party billing or clearing company engaged by us, and is not kept by us.
- Voluntary information: We also collect information which you provide us voluntarily. For example, when you respond to communications from us, ask for our support, communicate with us via email or share additional information about yourself through your use of the Services.
- Device information: We also collect specific types of connection details and information with regard to your device, software or hardware that may identify you, such as: online identifiers, device’s unique identifiers (e.g. UDID, MAC address), operating system, IP address, and geolocation.
- Information from connected accounts: We collect information which is available via accounts for which you provide us with login information and which is relevant to our Services.

#### Non-Personal Information

Non-personal Information is non-identifiable information that, when taken alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you. As such, we are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-personal Information was collected.

- Analytics Data: Our servers automatically record certain information regarding the use of the Service. Such data may include information such as the website that a User was visiting before accessing to our Webpage and other statistics related to our Services.We analyze this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality. Such data is also used for troubleshooting errors and bugs as well as for research and analytics purposes about your use of the Services.For avoidance of doubt, if we combine Personal Information with Non-personal Information (e.g. analytics data), the combined information will be treated as Personal Information as long as it remains combined.
- Anonymous information: We may anonymize or de-identify the information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information cannot, on its own, personally identify you. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation and for any purpose.

#### User Data

We collect and analyze Customer’s activity on the Service and other data that is provided to us by Users (e.g. “User Data”). Such User Data is processed by us on our cloud computing servers. The Company collects such User Data as a “data controller”. Please note that such User Data may include Personal Information. If you (as a Customer or a User) submit to us or to third-parties acting on our behalf any Personal Information relating to other individuals (e.g. employees, end-users, etc.) in connection with your use of the Service, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
