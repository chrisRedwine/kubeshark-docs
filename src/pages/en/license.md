Kubeshark is a collection of four different projects, each with its own license.  

|Project |Type|Version|Link
|---|---|---|---|
|CLI|Apache|2.0|https://github.com/kubeshark/kubeshark/blob/master/LICENSE|   
|Front-end|Apache|2.0|https://github.com/kubeshark/front/blob/master/LICENSE|   
|Hub|BSL|1.1|https://github.com/kubeshark/hub/blob/master/LICENSE|   
|Worker|GPL|3.0|https://github.com/kubeshark/worker/blob/master/LICENSE|  

When using Kubeshark the least permissive license takes dominance. In this case its BSL 1.1.

## What is BSL 1.1 License

The BSL 1.1 License, also known as the Business Source License 1.1, is a software license designed to balance the benefits of open source with the needs of commercial software vendors. It is an evolution of the original BSL 1.0 License developed by MariaDB Corporation.

Under the BSL 1.1 License, the software is initially released as source code and can be freely accessed, modified, and redistributed. However, there are certain conditions that come into effect after a specified period, typically a fixed number of years or a specific date.

During the initial period, users can utilize the software under the terms of an open source license, typically the Apache License 2.0 or a similar permissive license. This allows for widespread adoption, collaboration, and innovation within the open source community.

After the specified period elapses, the BSL 1.1 License introduces additional restrictions. These restrictions may vary depending on the specific software and license version, but generally, they involve limitations on the redistribution of the software in a commercial context. This means that commercial users or vendors who wish to redistribute the software in a proprietary product or service may be required to purchase a commercial license or comply with certain conditions set forth by the licensor.

The BSL 1.1 License aims to strike a balance between openness and the need for sustainable business models for software vendors. It encourages collaboration and innovation in the open source community while enabling vendors to monetize their software after an initial period of widespread adoption.

## Why Did We Choose BSL 1.1 License

**Balanced Openness:** The BSL strikes an excellent balance between open source principles and ensuring the sustainability of the project. It grants users the freedom to view, use, and modify the source code, just like traditional open source licenses. However, it introduces a fair limitation on commercial exploitation for a specific period, giving the project a chance to grow and generate resources.

**Sustainable Growth:** By incorporating the BSL 1.1 license, we can ensure the long-term viability and health of the project. This license enables me, as the developer, to invest time and resources into improving the software without concerns about immediate commercial competition or erosion of the project's value.

**Encouraging Contributions:** By embracing the BSL 1.1 license, we aim to foster a vibrant community of contributors. Individuals and organizations can freely modify and contribute to the project, benefiting from the shared knowledge and collective expertise. This inclusive environment promotes collaboration, enhances the project's quality, and amplifies its potential impact.

**Flexibility for Future Evolution:** The BSL 1.1 license offers flexibility for future growth and evolution. Once the limited commercial restriction period ends, the project becomes fully open source, allowing unrestricted commercial usage. This transition ensures that the software remains accessible, adaptable, and continually contributing to the greater open source ecosystem.

In summary, the BSL 1.1 license strikes a harmonious balance between openness and sustainability, ensuring the project's growth and long-term success. By adopting this license, we encourage collaboration, attract financial support, and foster a thriving community of contributors. Together, let's build an inclusive and prosperous future for Kubeshark!
