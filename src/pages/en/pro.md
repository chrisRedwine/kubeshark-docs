Understanding that startups have different needs compared to enterprises, and that development and testing clusters have unique requirements compared to production clusters, **Kubeshark** offers three distinct editions. Each edition is tailored to meet the varied demands of different use-cases and company types.

For a detailed comparison of features across editions, visit our [pricing page](https://kubeshark.co/pricing).

## Community Edition

The Community Edition is complimentary and primarily targets small development and testing clusters. It is readily available for on-demand use without requiring a license.

> To begin using the Community Edition, [install Kubeshark](/en/install).

## Pro Edition

The Pro Edition caters to smaller clusters of up to 20 nodes in environments with active internet connectivity. It includes a one-month free license, with the option to upgrade using a credit card.

> Obtain your one-month free PRO license by executing `kubeshark pro` in the terminal, or sign up via the [Admin Console](https://console.kubeshark.co) for your Pro license.

## Enterprise Edition

Designed for larger organizations managing multiple, either managed or self-managed, clusters, the Enterprise Edition of **Kubeshark** is equipped with features suitable for demanding environments. These include:
- Enhanced high-speed/high-throughput capabilities
- Support for air-gapped environments
- SAML/SSO integration

Enterprise Edition users also benefit from dedicated support, ensuring swift assistance through Slack, on-demand Zoom calls, premium onboarding services, and a commitment to seamless operations across all clusters.

### SAML/SSO/Authorization

The Enterprise Edition allows developers to access Kubeshark through their corporate Identity Provider (IDP) without needing `kubectl` privileges. Authorization is based on group or organizational affiliation, with network traffic visibility controlled by namespace and pod regex rules aligned with their roles.

### Air-gapped Support

This edition enables the full feature set even without Internet connectivity, facilitating the local storage of Docker images, scripts, and kernel modules.

### Dedicated Support

Enterprise users receive immediate support through Slack, access to on-demand Zoom calls, premium onboarding, and a guarantee of smooth operations across all clusters.

### High-speed Networks

The Enterprise Edition enhances packet capture and processing speeds, significantly minimizing the overhead typically associated with kernel-level packet handling.
